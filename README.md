Trampolines for old and young . . . Vims.

A feature-poor relative of some affluent ‘cousins’, namely  
[1](https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava/blob/v5.0/core/src/main/java/fj/control/Trampoline.java) and [2](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.13.13/src/library/scala/util/control/TailCalls.scala).

See the accompanying examples for a particular version when  
this functionality may prove useful; despite their style,  
there is no requirement in following Church's precept about  
writing lambda abstractions so "that all free variables of  
the definiens be represented explicitly in the definiendum".
